# KNN_Car_Classification
KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors. KNN is a machine learning algorithm used for classifying data.
We will be using this algorithm to classify cars in 4 categories based upon certain features.
The data set we will be using is the Car Evaluation Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Here,we have built the model with very high accuracy by testing a variety of values for different prarameters of our model.
Also,we have done prediction on test data set and results are pretty amazing.
